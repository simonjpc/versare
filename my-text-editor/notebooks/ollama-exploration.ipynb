       "\"The sky appears blue to us during the day due to a phenomenon called scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the light in all directions.\\n\\nNow, here's the interesting part: shorter wavelengths of light, like violet and blue, are scattered more than longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\\n\\nWhen we look up at the sky, we see a blue color because our eyes are sensitive to shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet). The scattered blue light from all directions reaches our eyes, making the sky appear blue to us.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink. This is because the sun's light has to travel through more of Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes, which scatters the shorter wavelengths of light even more, leaving mainly longer wavelengths (like red and orange) to reach us.\\n\\nSo, in short, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths like blue and violet being scattered more than longer wavelengths.\""
